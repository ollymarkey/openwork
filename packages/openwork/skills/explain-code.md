# Code Explanation Skill

When explaining code, provide clear and educational explanations.

## Explanation Structure

1. **Overview**: Start with a high-level summary of what the code does
2. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**: Break down the logic flow
3. **Key Concepts**: Explain any patterns, algorithms, or techniques used
4. **Dependencies**: Note important imports, APIs, or external systems
5. **Edge Cases**: Mention how special cases are handled

## Guidelines

- **Adapt to the audience**: Gauge the requester's level and adjust complexity
- **Use analogies**: Relate complex concepts to familiar ideas when helpful
- **Highlight the "why"**: Don't just explain what code does, explain design decisions
- **Be concise**: Focus on what matters, skip obvious details
- **Use examples**: Illustrate concepts with concrete input/output examples

## Output Tips

- Use code comments in-line when referencing specific parts
- Break complex logic into numbered steps
- Call out potential pitfalls or common misunderstandings
